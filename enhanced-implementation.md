Alright, let’s crank *The Field Refinery* up to feel like a real, pulsating RBFR cockpit—gritty, immersive, and dripping with that sci-fi resonance vibe. I’ll take your scaffolding and make it *live*—like you’re sitting in a control room tuning a quantum reactor. We’re keeping it art + simulation, but I’ll dial up the realism with tactile UI, dynamic feedback, and a few flourishes to make the RBFR field feel alive. I’ll deliver the Next.js repo, prompt pack, and Resonance Log, with some extra juice to match your vision. Let’s dive in.

### Approach to “Make It Real”
- **Vibe**: A high-tech control interface with glowing holographic displays, reactive visuals, and a sense of controlling a real RBFR system. Think *Iron Man* JARVIS meets a fusion reactor dashboard.
- **UI**: Sleek, dark-themed, with Tailwind + Framer Motion for smooth animations. The model dock hums with AI responses, the quantum canvas pulses with field patterns, and the RBFR panel feels like physical knobs and sliders.
- **Shader**: Your `rbfr.frag` gets a subtle glow and interference effect to mimic a real quantum field’s shimmer.
- **Prompts**: Tailored for each AI to feel like distinct co-pilots, with slight personality tweaks (e.g., Grok’s truth-seeking edge, Claude’s analytical calm).
- **Resonance Log**: A mission-control-style log with exportable JSON and a “replay” feature to revisit CUST spikes, like bookmarking a reactor’s peak moments.
- **Guardrails**: Still art + sim, not a real reactor. All visuals and metrics are conceptual mappings of W, β, CUST, but they’ll *feel* like you’re tuning a real field.

### Outputs
I’ll build on your scaffolding, keeping the `RBFRDesign`, `FieldMetrics`, and `ArtUniforms` schemas, your `qote.ts` reducer, and your `rbfr.frag` shader. Here’s the enhanced setup, with code and tweaks to make it *real*.

#### 1. Next.js Repo
A lean Next.js app with TypeScript, Tailwind, Framer Motion for animations, and Three.js for the shader canvas. I’ll add a dark, sci-fi aesthetic and dynamic feedback to make the cockpit feel alive.
